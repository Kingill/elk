AMQ9616: The CipherSpec proposed is not enabled on the server.

EXPLANATION:
The SSL or TLS subsystem at the server end of a channel been configured in such
a way that it has rejected the CipherSpec proposed by an SSL or TLS client.
This rejection occurred during the secure socket handshake (i.e. it happened
before the proposed CipherSpec was compared with the CipherSpec in the server
channel definition). 

This error most commonly occurs when the choice of acceptable CipherSpecs has
been limited in one of the following ways: 
(a) The server queue manager SSLFipsRequired attribute is set to YES and the
  channel is using a CipherSpec which is not FIPS-certified on the server. 
(b) The server queue manager EncryptionPolicySuiteB attribute has been set to a
  value other than NONE and the channel is using a CipherSpec which does not
  meet the server's configured Suite B security level. 

The channel is '????'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and so is
shown as '????'. The channel did not start. 

The remote host name is 'centos6 (192.168.253.164)'.
ACTION:
Analyse why the proposed CipherSpec was not enabled on the server. Alter the
client CipherSpec, or reconfigure the server to accept the original client
CipherSpec. Restart the channel. 

This message might occur after applying WebSphere MQ maintenance because the
FIPS and Suite B standards are updated periodically. When such changes occur,
WebSphere MQ is also updated to implement the latest standard. As a result, you
might see changes in behavior after applying maintenance. For more information

AMQ9616: The CipherSpec proposed is not enabled on the server.

EXPLANATION:
The SSL or TLS subsystem at the server end of a channel been configured in such
a way that it has rejected the CipherSpec proposed by an SSL or TLS client.
This rejection occurred during the secure socket handshake (i.e. it happened
before the proposed CipherSpec was compared with the CipherSpec in the server
channel definition). 

This error most commonly occurs when the choice of acceptable CipherSpecs has
been limited in one of the following ways: 
(a) The server queue manager SSLFipsRequired attribute is set to YES and the
  channel is using a CipherSpec which is not FIPS-certified on the server. 
(b) The server queue manager EncryptionPolicySuiteB attribute has been set to a
  value other than NONE and the channel is using a CipherSpec which does not
  meet the server's configured Suite B security level. 

The channel is '????'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and so is
shown as '????'. The channel did not start. 

The remote host name is 'centos6 (192.168.253.164)'.
ACTION:
Analyse why the proposed CipherSpec was not enabled on the server. Alter the
client CipherSpec, or reconfigure the server to accept the original client
CipherSpec. Restart the channel. 

This message might occur after applying WebSphere MQ maintenance because the
FIPS and Suite B standards are updated periodically. When such changes occur,
WebSphere MQ is also updated to implement the latest standard. As a result, you
might see changes in behavior after applying maintenance. For more information
about the versions of FIPS and Suite B standards enforced by WebSphere MQ,
refer to the readme:

The SSL or TLS subsystem at the server end of a channel been configured in such
a way that it has rejected the CipherSpec proposed by an SSL or TLS client.
This rejection occurred during the secure socket handshake (i.e. it happened
before the proposed CipherSpec was compared with the CipherSpec in the server
channel definition). 

This error most commonly occurs when the choice of acceptable CipherSpecs has
been limited in one of the following ways: 
(a) The server queue manager SSLFipsRequired attribute is set to YES and the
  channel is using a CipherSpec which is not FIPS-certified on the server. 
(b) The server queue manager EncryptionPolicySuiteB attribute has been set to a
  value other than NONE and the channel is using a CipherSpec which does not
  meet the server's configured Suite B security level. 

The channel is '????'; in some cases its name cannot be determined and so is
shown as '????'. The channel did not start. 

The remote host name is 'centos6 (192.168.253.164)'.
ACTION:
Analyse why the proposed CipherSpec was not enabled on the server. Alter the
client CipherSpec, or reconfigure the server to accept the original client
CipherSpec. Restart the channel. 

This message might occur after applying WebSphere MQ maintenance because the
FIPS and Suite B standards are updated periodically. When such changes occur,
WebSphere MQ is also updated to implement the latest standard. As a result, you
might see changes in behavior after applying maintenance. For more information
about the versions of FIPS and Suite B standards enforced by WebSphere MQ,

AMQ9631: The CipherSpec negotiated during the SSL handshake does not match the
required CipherSpec for channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'.

EXPLANATION:
There is a mismatch between the CipherSpecs on the local and remote ends of
channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'. The channel will not run until this mismatch is
resolved. The CipherSpec required in the local channel definition is
'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA'. The name of the CipherSpec negotiated during
the SSL handshake is 'RC4_MD5_US'. A code is displayed if the name of the
negotiated CipherSpec cannot be determined.
ACTION:
Change the channel definitions for 'TESTV75.CX.APP01' so the two ends have
matching CipherSpecs and restart the channel. If the certificate in use by one
end of the channel is a Global Server Certificate, then the negotiated
CipherSpec may not match that specified on either end of the channel. This is
because the SSL protocol allows a Global Server Certificate to automatically
negotiate a higher level of encryption. In these cases specify a CipherSpec
which meets the requirements of the Global Server Certificate.

AMQ9631: The CipherSpec negotiated during the SSL handshake does not match the
required CipherSpec for channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'.

EXPLANATION:
There is a mismatch between the CipherSpecs on the local and remote ends of
channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'. The channel will not run until this mismatch is
resolved. The CipherSpec required in the local channel definition is
'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256'. The name of the CipherSpec negotiated during
the SSL handshake is 'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA'. A code is displayed if the
name of the negotiated CipherSpec cannot be determined.
ACTION:
Change the channel definitions for 'TESTV75.CX.APP01' so the two ends have
matching CipherSpecs and restart the channel. If the certificate in use by one
end of the channel is a Global Server Certificate, then the negotiated
CipherSpec may not match that specified on either end of the channel. This is
because the SSL protocol allows a Global Server Certificate to automatically
negotiate a higher level of encryption. In these cases specify a CipherSpec
which meets the requirements of the Global Server Certificate.

AMQ5542: The failed authentication check was caused by the queue manager
CONNAUTH CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED) configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The user ID 'uid=gilles,ou=people,dc=my-domain,dc=com' and its password were
checked because the queue manager connection authority (CONNAUTH) configuration
refers to an authentication information (AUTHINFO) object named 'RB' with
CHCKCLNT(REQUIRED). 

This message accompanies a previous error to clarify the reason for the user ID
and password check.
ACTION:
Refer to the previous error for more information. 

Ensure that a password is specified by the client application and that the
password is correct for the user ID. The authentication configuration of the
queue manager connection determines the user ID repository. For example, the
local operating system user database or an LDAP server. 

If the CHCKCLNT setting is OPTIONAL, the authentication check can be avoided by
not passing a user ID across the channel. For example, by omitting the MQCSP
structure from the client MQCONNX API call. 

To avoid the authentication check, you can amend the authentication
configuration of the queue manager connection, but you should generally not
allow unauthenticated remote access.

AMQ5541: The failed authentication check was caused by the queue manager
CONNAUTH CHCKLOCL(REQDADM) configuration.

EXPLANATION:
The user ID 'mqm' and its password were checked because the user ID is
privileged and the queue manager connection authority (CONNAUTH) configuration
refers to an authentication information (AUTHINFO) object named 'RB' with
CHCKLOCL(REQDADM). 

This message accompanies a previous error to clarify the reason for the user ID
and password check.
ACTION:
Refer to the previous error for more information. 

Ensure that a password is specified by the client application and that the
password is correct for the user ID. The authentication configuration of the
queue manager connection determines the user ID repository. For example, the
local operating system user database or an LDAP server. 

To avoid the authentication check, you can either use an unprivileged user ID
or amend the authentication configuration of the queue manager. You can amend
the CHCKCLNT attribute in the CHLAUTH record, but you should generally not
allow unauthenticated remote access.

AMQ9777: Channel was blocked

EXPLANATION:
The inbound channel 'SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' was blocked from address 'centos6
(192.168.253.160)' because the active values of the channel matched a record
configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active values of the channel were
'CLNTUSER(mqm) ADDRESS(centos6)'.
ACTION:
Contact the systems administrator, who should examine the channel
authentication records to ensure that the correct settings have been
configured. The ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH switch is used to control whether channel
authentication records are used. The command DISPLAY CHLAUTH can be used to
query the channel authentication records.

AMQ9631: The CipherSpec negotiated during the SSL handshake does not match the
required CipherSpec for channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'.

EXPLANATION:
There is a mismatch between the CipherSpecs on the local and remote ends of
channel 'TESTV75.CX.APP01'. The channel will not run until this mismatch is
resolved. The CipherSpec required in the local channel definition is
'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256'. The name of the CipherSpec negotiated during
the SSL handshake is 'TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA'. A code is displayed if the
name of the negotiated CipherSpec cannot be determined.
ACTION:
Change the channel definitions for 'TESTV75.CX.APP01' so the two ends have
matching CipherSpecs and restart the channel. If the certificate in use by one
end of the channel is a Global Server Certificate, then the negotiated
CipherSpec may not match that specified on either end of the channel. This is
because the SSL protocol allows a Global Server Certificate to automatically
negotiate a higher level of encryption. In these cases specify a CipherSpec
which meets the requirements of the Global Server Certificate.

AMQ9777: Channel was blocked

EXPLANATION:
The inbound channel 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN' was blocked from address 'centos6
(192.168.253.161)' because the active values of the channel matched a record
configured with USERSRC(NOACCESS). The active values of the channel were
'CLNTUSER(root) ADDRESS(centos6)'.
ACTION:
Contact the systems administrator, who should examine the channel
authentication records to ensure that the correct settings have been
configured. The ALTER QMGR CHLAUTH switch is used to control whether channel
authentication records are used. The command DISPLAY CHLAUTH can be used to
query the channel authentication records.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'centos6
(192.168.253.158) (1414)' for channel TESTV75.TO.PARIS was not successful.
However the error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to
successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'centos6 (192.168.253.158) (1414)' was not running.  If this is the case,
perform the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try
again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'centos6
(192.168.253.158) (1414)' for channel TESTV75.TO.PARIS was not successful.
However the error may be a transitory one and it may be possible to
successfully allocate a TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'centos6 (192.168.253.158) (1414)' was not running.  If this is the case,
perform the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try
again.

values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'centos6 (192.168.253.158) (1414)' was not running.  If this is the case,
perform the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try
again.

AMQ9999: Channel 'TESTV75.TO.PARIS' to host 'centos6(1414)' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 37161 for channel
'TESTV75.TO.PARIS' ended abnormally. The host name is 'centos6(1414)'; in some
cases the host name cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be
found in the System Administration Guide.
